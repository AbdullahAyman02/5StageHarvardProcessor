#	All numbers are in hex format
#	We always start by reset signal (in phase one, it just reset all registers)
# 	This is a commented line
#	You should ignore empty lines and commented ones
# 	add as much NOPs (or for example `LDM R7, 0` (a filling instruction)) as you want to avoid hazards (as a software solution, just in 
#          phase one)
# ---------- Don't forget to Reset before you start anything ---------- #
# LDM, NOT, DEC, MOV, OR, CMP

			# means the code start at address zero, this could be written in 
			# several places in the file and the assembler should handle it in Phase 2
